# Bear with Pizza Logo

## Image Requirements

Please add a custom image file named `bear-with-pizza.png` to this folder.

The image should be:
- A silhouetted California grizzly bear (like the one on the California flag)
- In blue color (#003262 - Berkeley blue)
- With a pizza in its mouth
- PNG format
- Recommended size: 512x512px or larger (will be scaled down to 96x96 in the app)
- Transparent background preferred

## Design Tips

1. Start with a California grizzly bear silhouette (you can find templates online)
2. Color it in Berkeley blue (#003262)
3. Add a pizza slice or pizza graphic in the bear's mouth
4. Export as PNG with transparent background
5. Save as `bear-with-pizza.png` in this folder

The app will automatically apply the blue tint color, so if your image is already blue, that's perfect!
